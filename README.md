# cloud-resume-challenge-front-end
My website is a project I developed as part of Forrest Brazeal's Cloud Resume Challenge. It's deployed automatically through GitHub Actions using Terraform for infrastructure as code. The website is hosted on AWS, leveraging services such as S3 for storage, CloudFront for content delivery, and Route 53 for DNS management.
